This is the interim website for the Leighton Buzzard Extinction Rebellion group

This will be replaced with a more complete site soon!

In the meantime, we have a mailing list for the group - please send your details to <lbxr-tech@protonmail.com> and we will add you to our list, or attempt to answer your questions.
