Welcome to the Leighton Buzzard Extinction Rebellion group

We are a new, fairly small group - and with the Coronavirus lockdown, we have been quite quiet lately!

But the climate crisis hasn't gone away - we are keen to keep conversations open, and be ready to safely re-ignite the climate fight when we can.

If you want to join the group, we have an announcements mailing list, and a [Mattermost](https://mattermost.com/) chat for group conversations.

For more information on joining or anything else, please email us at <lbxr-tech@protonmail.com>.
