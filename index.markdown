Welcome to the Leighton Buzzard Extinction Rebellion group

We are a new, fairly small group - and with the Coronavirus lockdown, we have been quite quiet lately!

But the climate crisis hasn't gone away - we are keen to keep conversations open, and be ready to safely re-ignite the climate fight when we can.

If you want to join the group, we have an announcements mailing list, and are moving towards Mattermost for group conversations.

If you want to join the group, please email us at <lbxr-tech@protonmail.com> and we will send you further information.


In the meantime, we have a mailing list for the group - please send your details to <lbxr-tech@protonmail.com> and we will add you to our list, or attempt to answer your questions.
