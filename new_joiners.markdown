## New Joiners Information

Hi folks!  We are happy to set up your group membership - please note that this includes accepting the Extinction Rebellion [Terms of Service](https://cloud.extinctionrebellion.org.uk/index.php/s/c8bWip6iQnoLyYE), [Privacy Policy](https://cloud.extinctionrebellion.org.uk/index.php/s/9bBRewnq5wttNdX) and [Culture and Expectations](https://cloud.extinctionrebellion.org.uk/index.php/s/MfNRxE7N2oHWQZG).

If you are happy with these and still wish to join, please confirm this in email to <lbxr-tech@protonmail.com>, along with the name and email address you'd like to use.

## How we communicate

At the moment we have two means of communication:

- A mailing list - this currently uses Google Groups to share announcements and emails between group members.  Note it does not keep your email address confidential from other list members; if you post anything to the group it will show your email address in the "from:" address.  If you want to join the list but stay anonymous, you could set up a new email address at <protonmail.com> or any other email service.
- [Mattermost](https://mattermost.com/) chat - this is a Chat tool similar to Slack, Google Hangouts Chat or Microsoft Teams. This system requires you to open the [Mattermost](https://mattermost.com/) web application or mobile applications, it is much more conducive to private casual conversations than email.

## Getting started

Once you have confirmed you are happy with the agreements above, we will add you to two systems, and you will receive two emails:

1. You will be (manually) added to the mailing list, and will receive a welcome message and instructions on the list
2. You will receive an email from "xrukadmin" giving instructions on joining the XR chat and discussion groups - it will look something like this:

> Hi,
> I (Admin Name) would like to invite you to join the rest of the Leighton Buzzard group in the new XRUK chat and discussion areas online.
>
> Please click this link https://blah and fill in the simple form to specify your username and password - remember these, you will need them to login.

There will also be a number of links to a further introductory information.  (This page is an attempt to just give you enough to get started - the full docs can be overwhelming!)

## Signing up

When you follow the link in the email, you should see a form like this hosted on auth.extinctionrebellion.org.uk :

There is inline help on this page to assist you further.  Once you click "confirm" you will receive two more emails:

1. "You've joined organisation.earth" - this is from Mattermost to confirm your email address, once you click "Verify Email" you will be able to log in to Mattermost
2. "Your UK Cloud account was created" - this is access information for UK cloud - more on that in a bit.

You should also be redirected to a "Home" page at <https://auth.extinctionrebellion.org.uk/> which has icons for each of the other systems:

![XR hub home](/assets/images/hub_home.png)

This is the easiest way to log in to the systems, though you can just bookmark them and use the login details you entered earlier.  (Some systems also have a "log in via UK hub" button)

## What are these systems?

* **The Hub** - this is the <https://auth.extinctionrebellion.org.uk/> site, it really exists just to coordinate users and logins on the other sites
* **UK Forums** - this is an email-like forum system, the Leighton Buzzard group is not really using this yet, though you can use it to chat to other XR groups
* **UK Cloud Storage** - this is a file storage and document authoring system, we can use it to share documents amongst the group.
* **Mattermost Chat** - this is the chat app, probably this is what we'll use most

## How do I use Mattermost

You can log in on the hub page above, or go to <https://organise.earth> and log in, or there are desktop and mobile apps as well at <https://mattermost.com/download/> 

When you log in you should see a screen similar to this:

![Mattermost screenshot](/assets/images/mattermost.png)

At the far left are icons for "Teams" - top level groups, you should see two of these for now.

Next to this is a list of "Channels" - these are individual chat areas, you can select any of these to talk to people, or click "More..." to explore other channels.  You can even add new public or private channels if you want!

You are automatically joined to two Teams and a few Channels:

- The UK team is for all of the UK, it includes "reception" channels which are public places to talk to people
  - we have a public "Leighton Buzzard Reception" channel here, this is where people outside our group can talk to us
- The South East team is for south-eastern UK group
  - we have a *private* "Leighton Buzzard" group here, which we can use for our conversations.

## That's all for now

If you have more questions, feel free to contact <lbxr-tech@protonmail.com> and we will try to help.
