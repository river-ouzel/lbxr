Hi folks - things have been very quiet in Leighton Buzzard XR due to coronavirus lockdown.

We are starting to get moving again a bit now - and also, we are trying out the new XR platforms, including the Mattermost chat tool for our conversations.

If you are not already a member, feel free to contact us at <lbxr-tech@protonmail.com> and we can join you to the mailing list / mattermost system.
